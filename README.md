Hello, I'm a spanish electronic engineering student, looking to share some of my projects of embeddeed systems, and getting some ideas for future projects.
I'm really interested in microcontrollers, electronic circuits, control, automation & robotics.
I usually program development boards such as ESP32, STM32 411CEU6...
I also would like to learn some phyton.

Un saludo!
